In order to get Koan.xcode to build, you need to also get the J3Terminal code
out of source control.  However, you do /not/ want the entire J3Terminal source
tree.  From the root directory of your koan sandbox, issue the following
command.

$ svn co svn+ssh://elysium.arete.cc/var/svn/j3terminal/trunk/source j3terminal

That should get you what you need in order to make Koan.xcode build.

If you want the entire J3Terminal tree, I suggest you check it out outside of
the koan sandbox.  So, for example, if you were in your root koan directory,
you'd do the following.

$ cd ..
$ svn co svn+ssh://elysium.arete.cc/var/svn/j3terminal/trunk j3terminal
$ cd -
$ ln -s ../j3terminal/source j3terminal
